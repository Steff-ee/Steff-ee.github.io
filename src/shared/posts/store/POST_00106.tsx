			With the year’s end approaching, talk of best movie of the year has begun. And with it,
			the familiar patterns emerge: People who aren’t film critics or obsessive cinephiles
			rank popular films as their favorites because it’s hard to favor films they never saw.
			Critics, who watch as many films in a week as the regular bloke watches in a year,
			understandably tire of too-common story arcs, character types, and other tropes faster
			than the general public tires of them, which causes critics to favor innovative,
			unusual, or in-the-eyes-of-anyone-else just plain weird films. And while this might
			cause perennial bickering in between the hoi polloi and the snobs, it’s not the pattern
			I think should change. [caption id="attachment_493" align="aligncenter" width="320"]

			This cat is a snob. Don't be a snob.[/caption] I want people to stop discussing “best
			movies” altogether. Specifically, I want the “best” part dropped. How we use language
			influences how we think—though I don’t mean in the way George Orwell imagined. In his
			acclaimed novel 1984, a dialect of English called Newspeak was designed by the novel’s
			totalitarian regime to constrict vocabulary and thus restrict the thoughts of its
			citizens. The idea was that people would be unable or less likely to consider concepts
			they had no words for. It’s an intriguing notion, and one I’ve always thought was
			ridiculous, even as a kid. We come up with words for new concepts—and new words for old
			concepts—every day. In the real world, illegal drugs have a long and ignominious history
			of synonyms generated precisely because of their illegality (imagine a totalitarian
			regime trying to censor words like “snow” and names like “Mary Jane” just to censor
			cocaine and marijuana, respectively). I find it more believable that it’s other people’s
			daily use of language that affects how we think rather than anything intrinsic about
			language itself. The politically charged phrases “pro-life” and “pro-choice” may have
			shaped how we think about that particular debate, but if they have, it’s only because we
			as English speakers agreed to adopt them as pithy slogans in lieu of actual, specific
			arguments. Obviously, politics and totalitarian regimes are matters of far more
			importance than ranking favorite movies—but I figure me and my friends will be debating
			our favorite films of the year for all our remaining years, so hell, why not do it
			right? The phrase “best movie of the year” is nonsense. Film is an artform too complex,
			too multi-faceted, and rewarding in too many different ways for any one film to be the
			overall “best” in any given year. Take the year 2016. The film that made me laugh most
			was Shane Black’s slapstick neo-noir <em>Nice Guys</em>. It was a perfect summer film
			(barring the fact it was released in May), but it wasn’t the most fun film I saw that
			year; that title belongs to Park Chan-wook’s delightfully clever crime-romance{' '}
			<em>The Handmaiden</em>. On the other end of the spectrum,{' '}
			<em>Manchester by the Sea</em> was the least fun film I saw that year, but also the most
			harrowing, a story of grief I appreciate having seen but will never see again.
			Depressing as it was, however, <em>Manchester</em> didn’t make me cry; my tearjerkers of
			2016 were <em>Fences</em> (thanks to August Wilson’s stellar screenplay and Denzel
			Washington’s equally stellar performance), <em>Hacksaw Ridge</em> (easily the worst
			movie in this list, but elevated by its subject matter, the real life hero Desmond
			Doss), and <em>Hidden Figures</em> (which is the only film I’ve ever seen in my life
			that made me cry tears of joy). To call a film “best” is to say it measures up to more
			than any other, but it assumes we have a universal metric with which to measure. Fans
			can measure films by how often they revisit their favorites year after year—by which
			metric <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> would be my favorite film of all time, and you
			know what, I’m perfectly fine with that, so sue me. Others might measure films by how
			deeply they explore the human condition, and while that sounds snobby as all hell, I
			think every story (even <em>The Hangover</em>) has at least something (however trite) to
			say about humans and how we behave in the most stressful, adventurous, or ridiculous of
			scenarios. And those who actually work on films might measure them by innovations
			brought to the craft—as they did last year, when the Academy gave its “Best Picture”
			award to an indie film that combined a novel three-act structure with the most intimate
			cinematography I’ve ever seen. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="1600"]

			Alex R. Hibbert and Mahershala Ali were only two of the many outstanding cast members of
			2016's <em>Moonlight</em>.[/caption] So what’s the alternative? Break it down. Many
			award shows already distinguish between comedy and drama; why not break it down further:
			Most delightful. Most emotional. Most interesting. Most innovative—whatever. There are a
			lot of categories that could replace “best”, but which of them are best, I don’t know.
