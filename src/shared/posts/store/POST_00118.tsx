			<p>Rating books has become anathema to my enjoyment of them.</p>
			<p>
				I started using GoodReads four years ago to track my reading list and discover more
				books. I recommend the app. For a few months, I was reading reviews of books{' '}
				<a href="https://www.fantasyliterature.com/" target="_blank">
					online
				</a>{' '}
				followed by more reviews on GoodReads, spending almost as much time curating books
				to read as actual reading.
			</p>
			<p>
				That habit faded, but it was replaced with a new habit: I started rating books that
				I read.
			</p>
			<p>
				Even while in the middle of reading them, I would start to speculate about my
				eventual rating of them, and devise preliminary arguments to defend my rating.
			</p>
			<div style={listStyle}>
				<li>
					"This is really good, but it's not one of the best books <i>ever</i>, so unless
					the ending blows me away, this is probably four stars."
				</li>
				<li>
					"This is better than The Malaise of Mediocrity, but it's not as good as The
					Satisfying Satyr. I want to give it three-and-a-half stars, but I can't. Ugh."
				</li>
			</div>
			<p>Etc.</p>
			<p>
				I reserved five star ratings for the best of the best, and distributed my ratings
				somewhat like this:
			</p>
			<DisplayTable
				disableListMode={true}
				headers={[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}
				data={[['5%', '20%', '35%', '35%', '5%']]}
			/>
			<p>
				The more I did it, the more annoying the process became, and yet the harder to stop.
				I didn't want to wage internal debates about the difference between three stars and
				four; I just wanted to enjoy reading.
			</p>
			<p>
				A single person's rating reflects the person rating it as much as the thing being
				rated. The more you put into a book, after all, the more you get out of it. Every
				second I spent critically rating a book was one second I could have spent critically
				engaging with the book's characters and themes. I <i>knew</i> this wasn't ideal, and
				yet I couldn't stop.
			</p>
			<p>Then I read Will Wight's Unsouled series.</p>
			<p>
				By the system I'd set up for myself, the books didn't quite reach the bar to make
				five stars, but I <i>wanted</i> to give them five stars. I wanted other people to
				read these book and share my love of them. Who stood to gain by me withholding an
				arbitrary star?
			</p>
			<p>
				So I said "screw the system" and gave them each five stars, then went back and
				upgraded a bunch of my other ratings as well. Now my distribution looks more like
				this:
			</p>
			<DisplayTable
				disableListMode={true}
				headers={[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}
				data={[['2.5%', '5%', '15%', '25%', '30%']]}
			/>
			<p>
				Notice it doesn't add up to 100%: Not having to rate every book means not having to
				worry so much about all this.

				The Unsouled series is all about characters leveling up their magical disciplines.

				Here's another poem inspired by a randomly generated line. This time the line was
				"Languish on the sun, and reach the tempest,".
