				. It’s a popular tune, undeniably catchy. And it's interesting that it should be so
				beloved, because its lyrics are diegetic <i>bullshit</i>.
			</p>

			<p>
				The song was sung into existence, in-universe, at the end of The Witcher’s second
				episode, by the comedic relief character Jaskier. He begins to faithfully adapt the
				events he and Geralt experienced in the episode, singing:
			</p>

			<PullQuote
				lines={[
					`"Will the elf king heed / what the witcher entreats?`,
					`Is history a wheel / doomed to repeat?"`,
				]}
				by={`Jaskier 'Dandelion' Pankratz`}
			/>

			<p>
				And then declares it shit, instead launching into a revised version of events full
				of fanciful elaborations and bad puns. Geralt rightly accuses him of being
				disrespectful—he’s not only disrespecting history, but the elves, who Jaskier paints
				as villains rather than refugees. It’s, in retrospect, an awful song.
			</p>

			<p>So why does the song sound so epic?</p>

				At the end of The Boys’s second episode, the somewhat comedic but also main
				character Hughie murders a superhero, then the credits roll to{' '}
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YI1zFQF-T8" target="_blank">
					Cherry Bomb
				</a>
				. It’s shocking and gruesome, silly and juvenile. It evokes Walter White’s descent
				into criminality in Breaking Bad, minus the narrative that deconstructs Walter’s
				highly fragile ego and balances his badass moments with dramatic tragedy. Hughie’s
				murder is pure revenge porn; the viewers delight in the frisson of watching him
				(literally) get his hands dirty, finally taking action against the villains that
				(debateably) deserve it.
			</p>

			<p>
				The key word here is “action”, as in “call to action”, or more commonly,{' '}
				<a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey#The_Call_to_Adventure"
					target="_blank"
				>
					“call to adventure”
				</a>
				. It’s thrilling to see the timid Hughie starting to fight back after two episodes
				of being reactive and being taunted. Not only does he accept the call to action, but
				he does so explosively—in what turned out to be my favorite moment of the series.
			</p>

			<p>
				Toss A Coin To Your Witcher also marks the call to adventure, but in a different
				way, and to different effect. Rather than being hyper-focused on a single
				character’s choice (like Hughie getting his hands dirty, with other characters
				present only to heighten the suspense), the Toss A Coin scene develops <i>five</i>{' '}
				characters at once. Ciri’s friendship with Dara grows as she learns his name, his
				species, and the fact that he can speak. Geralt and Jaskier find respect, if not for
				history, then for each other. And Yennifer accepts a call to action in a way that
				contrasts starkly with Hughie’s: Yennifer’s sadistic glee unsettles us, while we
				question whether the show intends for her to be a third protagonist or a relatable
				villain.
			</p>

			<p>
				It’s worth mentioning that The Witcher’s multiple timelines and time-skips make the
				narrative at times hard to follow, so much so that the show’s most common complaint
				is that it’s confusing. This is a flaw, certainly, but also an unusual strength: It
				keeps the viewers on their toes, not knowing what to expect next.
			</p>

			<p>
				When witnessing Yennifer accept her call to action, we experience a mixed frisson:
				Pride that she has overcome her obstacles. Fear that she is turning to the dark
				side. Wonder at where the show will take her.
			</p>

			<p>
				And what of Geralt, our prevailing champion and friend of humanity? A part of him is
				no doubt tired of Jaskier’s bullshit, but another part of him wonders if Jaskier is
				right about the nature of history and stories. Geralt can’t do his job as the
				“butcher of Blaviken,” but as the “friend of humanity” he could do more good. The
				song makes him into a legend, but also a legend that he could aspire to be worthy
				of—which is exactly what the audience wants. The song might be bullshit, but we
				don’t care because we want a hero. And if it <i>is</i> bullshit, because the true
				story is gray—look no further than Yennifer—then this serves to draw us deeper into
				the world of The Witcher, a world both confusing and Surprising (the capital S
				becomes important, later) and unveiled to us slowly with each monster-of-the-week.
			</p>

			<p>
				Toss A Coin is powerful because it comes at exactly the right time: not only when
				the characters accept their calls to adventure, but when we as an audience begin to
				understand what the show is really all about. Neither a drama driven by its
				over-arching season plot, nor episodic genre-fare, The Witcher is instead{' '}
				<i>both</i>. The episodic nature is gratifying to those who want to lackadaisically
				spend more time with Geralt (the same way I loved spending time with{' '}
				<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/10148/10148-h/10148-h.htm" target="_blank">
					Robin Hood and his Merry Adventures
				</a>{' '}
				when I was a kid), while the character development and season arc makes the “next”
				button irresistible.
