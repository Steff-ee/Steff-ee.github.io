				<i>Report from the Foundation of Paranormal Conservation & Surveys.</i>
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Designation:</b> PCS-EEAAO
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Status:</b> Extent/active.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Tags:</b> Nonsentient. Reproducible. Visible/mundane.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Discovered:</b> March 25, 2022, calendar Standard/prime.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Current location:</b> [REDACTED]
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Rules of acquisition and reproducibility:</b> [REDACTED]
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Threat response and collateral mitigation:</b> [ERROR]
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Description:</b> When inactive, an instance of PCS-EEAAO alternatingly manifests
				as either an earpiece, a wristwatch, or a fake mustache. When worn, it can be
				activated by [REDACTED]. When activated, the wearer (hereafter referred to as the
				"subject" or "subject-prime") will have their mind swapped with a multiversal
				other-self. [See PCS-EE001 for information regarding the multiverse; see PCS-AC006
				for information regarding the continuity of mind and actions that subvert it.] The
				other-self will control subject-prime’s body while subject-prime controls the
				other-self’s body. In testing, this control swap lasts up to 24 hours [See Addendum
				5], though no upper limit to the duration of swapping has yet been theorized [See
				Addendum 5b].
			</p>
			<p>
				The activation steps outlined above seem to be necessary but not alone sufficient to
				trigger a multiverse mind swap with PCS-EEAAO. A significant synchronicity between
				the minds of prime-self and other-self is highly likely a requirement. According to
				researcher Dr. Quan, both selves must be “one and the same” for activation to occur.
				[See Addendum 1 for data points.]

				<b>Addendum 1:</b> <i>Overview of known activations of PCS-EEAAO.</i>
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Activation 0:</b> [ERROR]
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Activation 1:</b> Verified/Foundational. Dr. Quan was an assistant in the initial
				investigations into PCS-EEAAO and also a voluntary subject in test trials. After
				activating PCS-EEAAO, Dr. Quan swapped with an other-self. At the time of swapping,
				Dr. Quan’s other-self was investigating their other-version of PCS-EEAAO in an
				identical manner to investigation-prime. The swap lasted for 23 hours and 58
				minutes, during which neither version of Dr. Quan was able to discern any
				differences between verse-prime and other-verse. [See Addendum 1b for test notes.]
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Activation 2:</b> Verified/Foundational. In a follow-up to Activation 1, under
				similar circumstances and variables controlled, Dr. Quan underwent another swap,
				this time while playing a solitary card game involving chance. After swapping, minor
				differences between the verses became immediately evident. No major differences were
				discovered. [See Addendum 1c for test notes.]
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Activation 3:</b> Verified/external. Subject [REDACTED] swapped with their
				other-self despite both selves being located in different positions on Earth,
				[REDACTED]. They were asleep at the time of swapping and reported having dreamed the
				same dream. Swap lasted 1 hour. Other-Earth was reported to have similar yet
				distinct geopolitics. Subject speculated that the other-verse branched on June 7,
				2016, calendar Standard. [See Addendum 1c for subject interview.]
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Activations 4-11:</b> Unverified/plausible. Following [Incident EE-222], all of
				the following subjects experienced swaps: [REDACTED]. One activation involved
				inebriants, another involved meditation, and the rest involved moments of highly
				focused “flow”, i.e., the mental state exhibited when subjects engaged in the
				playing of music, sports, or in one case, fornication. Swaps lasted between 16 to 21
				hours. Other-verses were reportedly distinct to significant degrees, but all
				accounts are unreliable. [See Incident EE-222 for more information.]
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Activations 12-47:</b> Verified/external. During [Incident EE-223], fifty members
				of a cult all attempted activation during a ritual involving inebriants and
				practices intended to induce meditative flow states. Thirty-six subjects succeeded.
				The subjects who succeeded skewed younger. The [REDACTED] older subjects who
				succeeded had shorter swaps, lasting on average 5 hours, while the longest swaps
				were had by the [REDACTED] children, each lasting 24 hours. It is theorized that
				less complex minds can more easily synchronize. Dr. Quan: “Age and experience bring
				with them growing differences, branching etchings on our multiversal blank slates.”
				[See Incident EE-223 for more information.]
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Activation 48:</b> Unverified/impossible.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Activation 49:</b> Debated/plausible. During [Incident EE-318], child celebrity
				[REDACTED] swapped into their twin sibling’s other-self. Swap lasted 12 hours. The
				other-verse was reportedly identical to verse-prime in geopolitics from a macro
				scale, but differed innumerably from a micro scale. [See Incident EE-318 for more
				information.]
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Activation 50:</b> Verified/external. Dr. Quan, no longer with the Foundation
				after [Incident EE-226], became the lead guitarist of a rock cover band. The band
				performed at a British musical festival, giving the biggest performance of the
				band's history, for an audience of approximately 300 British rock fans. Inebriants
				were had prior to the performance. During the encore, Dr. Quan engaged in a
				particularly intricate guitar solo and activated PCS-EEAAO. Despite the differences
				in their identity, inclinations, intelligence, and gender, Dr. Quan swapped into the
				multiversal mind of famed guitarist [REDACTED]. Swap lasted 12 minutes, 53 seconds.
				No differences between verses discerned. [See Incident EE-226 and EE-227 for more
				information.]
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Activation 51:</b> Verified/external. Subjects were a married couple, ages 90 and
				91, both now deceased. They were together engaged in a peaceful, loving afternoon of
				contemplative leisure. Witnesses reported that the couple knew they would soon pass.
				They activated two instances of PCS-EEAAO. Shortly after the swap’s conclusion, the
				couple passed together in their sleep. Unknown swap duration. Unknown if differences
				between verses were discerned. [Documentation MISSING. Does not appear to be an
				official redaction nor a system error. Will investigate. - Ed.]
