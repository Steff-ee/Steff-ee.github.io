				Nobody wants to be a Macbeth, or an Oedipus, doomed to experience a fate they cannot
				thwart. Perhaps a more pleasant fate would be welcome, but not an unknown fate:
				Having your life controlled by an external, ineffable destiny is terrifying. Most
				people would rather control their own fate—which is why so many reject the concept
				of{' '}
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism" target="_blank">
					determinism
				</a>{' '}
				in favor of free will.
			</p>

			<p>Even though nothing about determinism conflicts with humanity’s freedom of will.</p>

			<p>
				This debate is often framed using the hypothetical of repeatedly replaying the
				universe, from any given point in time, and observing the results. If every event
				(or at least, every human-observable event) plays out the same exact way every time,
				then the universe is deterministic and <i>surely</i> no one can have free will,
				being stuck as they are in this infinitely replaying videotape of a universe.
			</p>

			<p>
				Witness the Randolians, an alien species that lives on the planet Randomith. The
				only source of true randomness in their universe is the Rando particle. Randolians
				do not dream. Their mental skills can improve over time for tasks such as aiming
				projectiles or memorizing types of poisonous mushrooms. When presented with a
				choice, they will primarily use instinct, and sometimes use learned beliefs, to
				choose the least-unpleasant option presented. When presented with a near 50/50
				choice, or a choice they do not understand, they use a Rando particle in their brain
				to choose randomly. When presented with a belief from another Randolian (such as
				“All purple mushrooms are bad”) they again rely on their Rando particle to choose
				whether or not to accept this belief. They never question their own beliefs,
				choices, or motives; their language has no word for “doubt”.
			</p>

			<p>
				On another planet live the Maerdians. Their planet has no Rando particles
				whatsoever. Maerdians are born with enough instinct to get them through early
				development, but after that they largely rely on inner beliefs to make choices.
				Every morning, afternoon, evening, and dream, they reflect on their own choices and
				the choices of others so as to make better choices in the future. They have words in
				their language for “doubt”, “unknowable”, “regret”, “misconception”, and “congress”.
			</p>

			<p>Which of these species has more free will?</p>

			<p>
				Certainly not the Randolians. Though their actions will play out differently on
				different replays of the universe, they are not responsible for the change in their
				actions; their Rando particles are. And the Rando particles themselves could hardly
				be said to have free will. Though their actions are not deterministic, the same
				could be said of any species of Rando-particle-influenced ant.
			</p>

			<p>
				Freedom of will does not stem from randomness. I argue that it stems from one of the
				many things that separate us and Maerdians from calculators and ants: metacognition.
				The ability to change our own decision-making apparatus. Whether or not we live in a
				deterministic universe is a quirk of{' '}

				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minority_Report" target="_blank">

				</a>
				, it has zero bearing on the philosophy, ethics, and moral responsibility of how we
				live our lives. I'm not arguing that our universe is deterministic (I have no idea),
				but that even if our every passing moment <i>was</i> the causal result of a billion
				subtle factors and a billion billion steps we took along the way to that moment and
				the staggering, might-as-well-be-infinite number of factors and steps that led to
				the exact circumstances of our genetic and environmental creation, it wouldn’t
				matter. It wouldn't matter because our choices are our own—and because we recognize
				that our choices are our own, and we can act on that realization.
